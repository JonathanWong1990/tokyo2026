# Dad's trip page

A phone-first, read-only page for the family (Traditional Chinese by default, with an English toggle). It will be hosted on GitHub Pages.

- `trip-data.js` holds **all the content**. `calendar` is the day-by-day plan (shown in the 每日 tab, one page per date at `#/day/YYYY-MM-DD`); `ideas` A–L are the other options (選擇 tab). Update this file when the plan changes. The format is described at the top of the file.
- `place-info.js` holds each place's description: `about`, `todo` (what to do) and `tips`, keyed by the place id from `trip-data.js`.
- `place-img.js` plus `img/` hold the photos. Use free-licensed Wikimedia Commons images only, resized to about 960px, and fill in the credit fields (the page is public).
- `index.html` holds the layout and design: a small app with a bottom tab bar and a page per place (`#/place/<id>`). It shouldn't need changes when the content changes.
- `_drafts/` holds design explorations. Don't publish it.

Planning research lives in the markdown files in the parent folder. That's the source of truth, and `trip-data.js` is the family-friendly version of it. Each round:

1. Increase `version`, set `updated`, and rewrite `changes` (what's new since the last version, in plain words).
2. Use first names: John, Vanjai, Ben, Christine ("我哋" for the planners is fine). Don't put booking references, passport details or phone numbers in it while the page is public.
3. Keep `status` as 計劃中 until the trip is final.
